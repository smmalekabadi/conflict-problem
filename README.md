# Simple Conflict Detector
This is a java translation of the [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/given-n-appointments-find-conflicting-appointments/)  Given n appointments, find all conflicting appointments.

# Files
In *src* file you can find 3 classes which are represent the each entity of our algorithm.
further information regarded to what are these class are available in mentioned link. 

## What Is Conflict Detector ?
A Conflict Detector tries to find the overlaps between periods. 

## Algorithm 
There are several way to find conflicts.
Obvious way is to check all the periods with each other which make time complexity O(n^2).
Another way is like above code which makes a tree and check it a bit with intelligence which make the time complexity O(nlogn). 
 

## Innovative Solution
If we want to have a better outcome and if we need to be fast we could make some limitation on querying Database or we could use Client device to do some processes.
